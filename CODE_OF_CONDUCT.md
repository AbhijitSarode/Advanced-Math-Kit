# Code of Conduct

## Overview

Welcome to Advanced Math Kit! We value the participation of every individual and want to create a welcoming and inclusive community. As contributors and maintainers of this project, we are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

- Harassment, whether public or private
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission

## Responsibilities of Maintainers

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards for acceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to address any behavior that does not align with this Code of Conduct. Actions may include editing or removing comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions, as well as temporarily or permanently banning any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
